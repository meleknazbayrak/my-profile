						I am 20 years old and I am from Turkey. Currently, I am a first-year Global BBA student at ESSEC Business School. I am a creative person and have always had a strong passion for fashion, which is why I want to pursue a career in fashion-related sectors such as fashion marketing or luxury brand management. My zodiac sign is Sagittarius, and I am an emotional person. In my free time, I love to dance and journal.</p>

				<h2><strong>Fashion</strong></h2>

				<h2><strong>Dancing</strong></h2>
					<p>Dancing involves rhythm, coordination with music, and expression. It’s a beneficial sport and activity for the body and a way of expressing emotions and ourselves to the audience. To me, dance is a way to understand myself while relieving stress.</p>

				<h2><strong>Journaling</strong></h2>
					<p>Journaling involves writing down thoughts, feelings, and experiences in a personal diary or journal. It doesn’t have any specific format, and you can choose the one that feels best for you. While journaling, you can forget about daily problems and be alone with yourself and your thoughts.</p>
